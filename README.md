📌 Overview
The Income Tax Calculator is a lightweight, front-end application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It runs entirely in the browser — no logins, no ads, no data collection — just fast and accurate slab-wise tax estimation.

Whether you're a salaried employee, freelancer, or just exploring how taxation works in India, this tool simplifies complex tax calculations and presents results in a clean, understandable format.

🚀 Why I Built This
As a developer and student, I noticed that many existing tax calculators are either filled with distractions or overly complex. I wanted to build something:

With a clean, distraction-free UI

That respects user privacy (no data storage)

Open-source and customizable

Practical enough to apply my front-end development skills to a real-world use case

This project is both a utility and a learning tool — turning a common financial task into an interactive web experience.

🧠 How It Works
This calculator uses progressive slab-based logic:

Income Range (₹)	Tax Rate
Up to ₹4,00,000	0%
₹4,00,001 – ₹8,00,000	5%
₹8,00,001 – ₹12,00,000	10%
₹12,00,001 – ₹16,00,000	15%
₹16,00,001 – ₹20,00,000	20%
₹20,00,001 – ₹24,00,000	25%
₹24,00,001 and above	30%

The tax is calculated progressively — each portion of your income is taxed at its respective rate, just like real-world tax computation.
